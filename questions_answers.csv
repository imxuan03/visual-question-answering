Bacterialblight,"What are the symptoms?","Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves that turn yellow and eventually die."
Bacterialblight,"How to control this disease?","Control measures include using resistant varieties and practicing crop rotation."
Bacterialblight,"What causes this disease?","The disease is caused by bacteria that thrive in warm, wet conditions."
Bacterialblight,"How does this disease affect yield?","Infected plants can have reduced yield due to leaf damage and stunted growth."
Bacterialblight,"What is the best time to apply control measures?","Control measures should be applied before the onset of rainy seasons when conditions favor the disease."

Blast,"What is the disease?","Blast is a fungal disease caused by *Magnaporthe oryzae* that can devastate rice crops."
Blast,"What are the symptoms?","Symptoms include dark, oval lesions on leaves and necks of rice plants that can lead to panicle blast."
Blast,"How to control this disease?","Control measures include using resistant varieties, applying fungicides, and maintaining proper field drainage."
Blast,"What causes this disease?","The disease is favored by high humidity, warm temperatures, and overcrowded planting."
Blast,"How does this disease affect yield?","Blast can cause significant yield losses, sometimes up to 50% in severe cases."

Brownspot,"What is the disease?","Brown spot is a fungal disease caused by *Bipolaris oryzae* affecting rice plants."
Brownspot,"What are the symptoms?","Symptoms include brown, round spots on leaves, and reduced tillering, leading to fewer panicles."
Brownspot,"How to control this disease?","Control measures include using resistant varieties, improving drainage, and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization."
Brownspot,"What causes this disease?","The disease is caused by a fungus that thrives in warm and humid conditions, particularly when fields are waterlogged."
Brownspot,"How does this disease affect yield?","Infected plants may exhibit reduced yield and poor grain quality due to fewer productive tillers."
Brownspot,"What preventive measures can be taken?","Crop rotation and proper field sanitation can help prevent the occurrence of brown spot disease."

Tungro,"What is the disease?","Tungro is a viral disease caused by Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV)."
Tungro,"What are the symptoms?","Symptoms include stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced yield, affecting the overall plant health."
Tungro,"How to control this disease?","Control measures include using resistant varieties and controlling the vector (leafhoppers) through insecticides."
Tungro,"What causes this disease?","The disease is spread by leafhoppers that carry the virus from infected plants to healthy ones."
Tungro,"How does this disease affect yield?","Tungro can lead to severe yield losses, sometimes exceeding 80% in heavily infected fields."
Tungro,"What measures can be taken to prevent this disease?","Regular monitoring for leafhoppers and using insect-resistant varieties can help prevent tungro."
